.DESCRIPTION

This script demonstrates automating the deployment of a SharePoint Framework Solution with the new SharePoint Online ALM PoSh cmdlets.

#>

# Initialize SPO connection variables
$user = ""
$creds = Get-Credential -UserName $user -Message "enter password please"
$appCatalog = "https://<your_tenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/appcatalog" #your app catalog URL may differ!


# In an automated deployment pipeline, it may make more sense to leverage App Only authentication
#
# e.g. Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://contoso.sharepoint.com -ClientId '<id>' -Tenant 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com' -PEMCertificate <PEM string> -PEMPrivateKey <PEM string>
#      
# https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-PowerShell/tree/master/Samples/SharePoint.ConnectUsingAppPermissions

Connect-PnPOnline -Url $appCatalog -Credentials $creds
# Test Connection
Get-PnPSite


############ Deployment Steps ############

# 1) Add to app catalog
# 2) Deploy to site(s)
# 3) Install on site(s)

############ ################ ############

#### Step 1
$path = "C:/Dev/spfx/extensions/application-customizers/ApplicationInsights-Ts/sharepoint/solution/app-insights-app-customizer.sppkg"

Add-PnPApp -Path $path

#### Step 2
$appId = (Get-PnPApp | ?{$_.Title -like "*app-insights*"}).id

# Use -SkipFeatureDeployment switch only when enabling Tenant wide deployment scope
Publish-PnPApp -Identity $appId -SkipFeatureDeployment

#### Step 3 (wrap the remaining commands in a foreach loop, iterating over each site you wish to install extension on)
# Disconnect from current context and create new context
$site = "https://<your_tenant>.sharepoint.com/<your_relative_url>"
Connect-PnPOnline -Url $site -Credentials $creds

#Test Connection
Get-PnPSite

# Install app for current site context
Install-PnPApp -Identity $appId

# Install-PnPApp installs the extension on the site and installs the custom action automatically
# Get-PnPCustomAction
